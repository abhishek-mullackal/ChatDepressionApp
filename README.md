About the App

Depression is a common and serious mental health condition that can have a significant impact on an individual's quality of life.
There is evidence to suggest that social media activity can provide insight into a person's mental health, and deep learning techniques have been applied to the task of detecting depression from social media data.
If their depression can be detected early by analysing their posts, then by taking the necessary steps, a person can be saved from depression-related diseases, or in the best case, he can be saved from committing suicide.
In this system, a simple social media blogging app that can detect depression by analysing users' textual posts has been proposed.
This data can be used to provide some support for the user to help them overcome their depressive state.
